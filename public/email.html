	<p>Hello Krista,</h4>
	<p>
		It's been about a week since your account was created and we've noticed that you haven't logged back in.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'd like to extend the opportunity for one of our team members to reach out to you and personally help you get setup. If you're available for 15 minutes this week, we can get you ready to start receiving feedback right away.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you'd prefer to setup yourself, be sure to check out our new <a href="http://jesse.workwoo.com/699yrz11m">Getting Started</a> walkthrough which explains how to get started and the basics of reporting.
	</p>

	<p>
		Cheers,<br>
		Jesse from WorkWoo
